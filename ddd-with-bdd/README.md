# Simples template DDD and BDD with ASP.Net Core 7

## What is the BDD?

Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is a software development approach that combines elements of test-driven
development (TDD) and domain-driven design (DDD). BDD focuses on the behavior of a software system from the perspective of its stakeholders, including business users, developers, and testers. It emphasizes collaboration, communication, and the creation of shared understanding among all project participants.

In BDD, the behavior of a software system is defined through examples or scenarios that describe the desired outcomes or behaviors in a structured and understandable format. These scenarios are typically written using a specialized language called Gherkin, which uses a Given-When-Then format. The Given-When-Then structure helps to define the preconditions (Given), actions (When), and expected outcomes (Then) of a particular scenario.

BDD encourages the collaboration of stakeholders, including developers, testers, business analysts, and domain experts, in defining these scenarios. This collaboration helps to ensure that all parties have a shared understanding of the system's behavior and requirements. The scenarios are typically expressed in a way that is easily understandable by non-technical stakeholders, facilitating effective communication between technical and non-technical team members.

The scenarios defined in BDD serve as executable specifications that can be automated and used as tests. Automated tools, such as Cucumber, SpecFlow, or Behat, can parse the Gherkin scenarios and execute the corresponding steps to verify that the system behaves as expected. By automating these tests, BDD helps to ensure that the system continues to meet the desired behavior even as it evolves and changes over time.

BDD promotes a shift in focus from individual components or functions to the behavior and outcomes of the system as a whole. It encourages the creation of small, incremental features or user stories that are driven by desired behaviors. This approach helps to align development efforts with the business value and goals of the software system, leading to improved collaboration, higher-quality software, and increased customer satisfaction.

Overall, Behavior Driven Development promotes collaboration, communication, and shared understanding among stakeholders, and it aligns software development efforts with desired system behaviors to deliver high-quality software that meets customer expectations.
